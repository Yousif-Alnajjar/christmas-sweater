# Ugly Christmas Sweater 
### Spiciest Meme winner at Hack112 (24h hackathon for students in CMU CS Intro class)

This is the interface for modifying the image being displayed on an ugly Christmas sweater with a screen (barely) attached.

ECE team members made the sweater and a receiver module on Python, I built this to send image and text information.
